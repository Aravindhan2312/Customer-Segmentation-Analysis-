# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis-
# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **customer segmentation** for an e-commerce company using unsupervised machine learning. By analyzing customer behavior and purchasing patterns, we group customers into meaningful clusters, enabling personalized marketing strategies and better business decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To perform customer segmentation using **K-Means Clustering**, allowing the business to:
- Identify distinct groups based on purchasing behavior
- Improve customer satisfaction
- Enhance targeted marketing efforts

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: [Mall Customers Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial)
- **Attributes**:  
  - CustomerID  
  - Gender  
  - Age  
  - Annual Income (k$)  
  - Spending Score (1–100)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – KMeans clustering

## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Exploration
- Understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset
- Handle missing or inconsistent data (if any)

### 2. Descriptive Analytics
- Compute statistical summaries
- Analyze distributions and correlations

### 3. Feature Selection
- Focused on key features such as **Age**, **Annual Income**, and **Spending Score**

### 4. Clustering
- Applied **K-Means Clustering**
- Used **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters

### 5. Visualization
- Created **scatter plots** to visualize clusters
- Used **pair plots**, **bar charts**, and **heatmaps** for deeper insights

---

## 📊 Results & Insights

- Identified clear customer segments (e.g., high income–low spenders, low income–high spenders, etc.)
- Helped determine where to focus loyalty rewards and where to improve engagement
- Gender and age also revealed valuable marketing insights

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Gained hands-on experience with **K-Means Clustering**
- Practiced **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis**, and **visual storytelling**
- Understood the business impact of segmentation in marketing strategies
